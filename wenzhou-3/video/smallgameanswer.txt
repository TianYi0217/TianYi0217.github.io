Today I went out shopping with Jimei and we wanted to get some amazing desserts.
We tried various flavors like coconut, red bean, milk tea, and added toppings
like taro balls, pudding, oats, and more. We even tried some sugar-free candies. 
We also ordered a hidden dessert from Chatime, and it was really delicious.
The individual packaging from Chatime was great. It was a fantastic experience!
Tomorrow, I have to go back to school. It's a bit frustrating that my roommates 
don't know much about things like E-house or listening to music. Anyway, tomorrow 
will be another busy day. I had a great time on the Happy Planet, even though I 
encountered a serious illness. But I'm not worried because it was just for fun. 
It's truly amazing! I wonder who you are? Everyone here on the Happy Planet is 
quite impressive. What kind of person are you? There is someone with a unique 
calculation ability here, but I won't reveal who it is because they possess it 
but haven't fully utilized it. Oh, by the way, Wuji Ge (a nickname) is not 
communicating or responding. Let's see what happens. Oh no, things are getting
urgent. Be brave like a bull, fear no difficulties. This is a piece of informal 
Chinese colloquialism. Please translate it in a more formal manner.
